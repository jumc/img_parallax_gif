## Abstract: 
Starting with a static image we try to retrieve objects at the same depth and separate them into images, each of them representing a different plane from the scene. Then we interpolate the blank spaces caused by the separation, extending the background. In order to produce the parallax effect we overlap the extended planes with slightly different displacements.
 
## How to use it:
1. Inside ```main.py```, change the file path for the source image at ```line 14```, for example:
```python
img = io.imread('input_images/test3.jpg')
```
2. Run it:
```shell
python main.py
```
3. The outpuf animation will be stored at ```./generated_gifs/```
