# img_parallax_gif
Starting with a static image we try to retrieve objects at the same depth and separate them into images, each of them representing a different plane from the scene. Then we interpolate the blank spaces caused by the separation, extending the background. In order to produce the parallax effect we overlap the extended planes with slightly different displacements.
